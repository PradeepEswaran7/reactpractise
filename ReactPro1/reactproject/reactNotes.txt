S/W prerequisit 
nodejs 
node -v
npm -v 

there are two ways to create react project 
1.npx: there is no need to install confuguration file 
     step1: npx create-react-app reactpro
     step2: cd reactpro
     step3: npm start 

2.npm: need to install confuguration file


*React:
-it is a javascript library
-which is use to create usser interfaces
-react create single Page Application
-it is not framework.


-react is component basis, in react app.js is root component 
-component: it is partial part of web app.
            -it can be any part like header,footer,nav 
            -which we can reuse 
-in react index.html is only single html file which render on browser.

How to get output on browser
localhost:3000 

-In React We have two type of component
1.function component: when your main foccus is on UI design 
2.class component: when you have deal with complex logic with UI 

How will you get output of individual component.
write component as tag where you want.


*JSX(javascript XML):-it makes react code easy
                     -it allows us to write html code in react.
                     -in jsx we must have one parent element to wrap another multiple element.
                     -parent element must be block element ex:div,p,h1,

*props: 
-it is parameter or funtional parameter which is use pass data inside component.
-it return object type of data 
-in function component we access it by writting props.propsName 
-in class component we access it by writting this.props.props


*state: 
-it is use to handle essential data in class component
-it is available in class component only.
-it return object type of data.
-it write in class component contructor.

*setState() method:
-it is use to manipulate state data in class component

*Events and function or methodin react
*how to change state property on custome by using event 


*use of extension By Eno Yao 
rafce : to create function component
rce: to create class component
rconst: to create contructor with super and state 


*how to access constant file data 

*how to use css 
1. inline css: in starting tag we will use style property in that we write css property and value
2. internal css: we css property in variable apply to an element
3. External css : create a seperate css file and import in component.
4. Module css : when we write css property for perticular component in that case we use it.
               and it will apply onl when you inmport it.
               -file must be sav with filename.module.css 

*how to normal bootstrap in react 
> npm i bootstrap

step1: install bootstrap
npm i bootstrap
step2: import it in index.js file 
import '../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
step3: use its inbuilt classes 

*component Interaction
-access data from parent component to child component
-to establish parent child relation in between component for that we write child component tas in parent component render method

*state as props to anothe component

HOC(Heigher Order component):
-when we have to share comman bussiness logic with multiple component in that case we use it.

*React.Fragment:
-it is an alternative for jsx 
-it remove unnecessary div element form react 
=========================================================

*conditional rendering 
-display component output or view on browser conditionaly 
1.if.. else : in this we put code in if and else block
2.element as variable : in this we store result in variable and we return that perticular variable 
3.ternary oprator : it is short hand syntax for if else 
                    syntax: (condition)?truepart:falsepart;
4.short circuit: it will render or display component output only when condition is true.
                 syntax: (condition) && data to return ;

*PureComponent: it prevent unnecessary re-rendering of class component.
*React.memo:it prevent unnecessary re-rendering of function component.


*Routing: 
-navigating component or display component output by writting in path in browser url 
-to perform routing in react for this we have to install react-router-dom library
>  npm i react-router-dom

-to perform routing we use BrowserRouter,Routes,Route

1.naming Routing: by wrting path in browser url to display component view 
2.default : display component by default without its name in browser url its must be blank.
3.prameterize routing: display component view by passing parameter with path name.
4.child Routing: defing one Routing inside another is called child routing, 
  -to display child component output in main for that we use <Outlet> library in main component.
5.wild-card Routing: 
-when we write wrong path name in browser url in that case redirect to this routing. 
-it is denoted by *
-it must be last routing, its beloow routing will never work.

*React Hooks: 
-it allows us to use class feature in function component.
-in react 16 version it introduce 
-in react we have 6 hooks 

1.useState Hooks:
-it allows us to use state in function component
-it gives two value in array 1.current-state,2.function to update current state 
-in usestate hook we can pass number,string,boolean and object type of data.
syntax: const [currentSate,FunctionToUpdateState] = useState();

*how to render list by using map 

*use of concurrently library
step1:npm i -g concurrently
step2:go to pakage.json file 
"json-server":"cd src/shared/Database && json-server --watch -p 8888 db.json",
"start:dev": "concurrently \"npm start\" \"npm run json-server\"",
step3: npm run start:dev


npm i -g json-server 
npm i -g concurrently

*Axios: it is use to make request form react Database server 
npm i axios 

*UseEffect():
-it perform side effect in function component.
-it use to perform dom manipulation 
-database connection 
-perform functionaly after rendering function component.

*what is Material UI 
-it is a seperate UI react library
-which provide inbuilt componet 


*how to install MUI 
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

*hhow to install material UI icon 
npm install @mui/icons-material

*we saw Axios 
*we perform get request
*we perform delete request 
*we perform post request
*we perform post request

*webstorage 
-it is use to store user data browser
1.local storage : it store user permnantly on browser
2.session storage : it will store user data for perticular time 

localStorage.setItem("user1","Shakti")
localStorage.getItem("user2")
localStorage.removeItem("user2")
localStorage.clear();

*useRef() hook: it allows to use dom node direclty and 
allows us to access its value and manipulate it.

*protcting component from unauthorize user 
*logout functionality 

*Redux:
-it is predictable state container for javascript Application
-it store state centernaly and allows user to manage ,access, track to it.
-it is not tied to react only,it will work with all javascript library (angular,react,viujs...)
-it is mainly responsible to manage state 

to use it in react firt we have install it 
> npm i redux 

to connect react and redux we have to install react-redux library
> npm i react-redux 

*redux works on three core core principle 
-Store : it hold state of javascript Application.
-Action : it is simple statment which we are going to perform 
-Reducer : it actually carryout state transition depending Action.

*folder tructure for reduc in react
src folder 
   -component folder
      -redux folder 
             -cakefolder 
                 -cakeType.js file
                 -cakeAction.js file 
                 -cakeReducer.js file 

             -store.js file 
             -index.js file     

*Action: it is plain javascript object which has type property containing string constant value.

*Reducer :-it is method which return new state after perform action 
          -it takes two parameter 1.initial-state, Action
          -in this we use switch case  

*state: in redux first we have create store from redux library
